wcalc.py will give T_{\infty} blackbody temperature limits for input
observing frequency, magnitude and distance.

wrapper.csh just calls wcalc.py for the magnitude limit of the 5 SDSS
bands. If you are looking at a patch of sky that has been seen by SDSS
but does not contain your source, then this would give you some
temperature upper limits.
